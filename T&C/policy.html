    <h2>8. Legitimate Interests</h2>
    Where we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process your information based on legitimate interests, we may rely on
    the following interests:
    
    Keeping our Services Safe and Secure: We use your information in certain instances as necessary to pursue our and
    your legitimate interests of keeping some of our Services, such as our domains, websites, apps, offices, events, and
    the integrity of draws and our services generally, safe and secure. For example, we collect IP addresses and process

    event which uses the Services, legal and regulatory authorities and payment service providers.

    We do this based upon the legal bases and exceptions mentioned in section 8 of this Notice.

    Service providers: We may share your personal information to help us provide our services and communicate with you.
    Categories of service providers include IT software and hosting providers and records-storage companies. Where such
    third parties are processors, these third parties are contractually required to use it only to provide their service
    to us and are contractually barred from using it for their own purposes.
    Business re-organisation: In instances where our business is subject to a re-organization, such as a merger or
    acquisition of some or all of its assets, we may, in accordance with our legitimate interests, need to share
    information in the course of the transaction. In such circumstances, your information may be disclosed, where
    permitted by applicable law, in connection with a corporate restructuring, sale, or assignment of assets, merger, or
    other changes of control or financial status of METADATA.ORG.
    <h2>10. Data Transfers</h2>
    In certain cases, we need to transfer your information to recipients outside the European Economic Area (‘EEA’),
    such as where it is necessary to provide the Services.

    Where we transfer your information, we do so in accordance with EU data protection law. We only transfer personal
    information to these countries when it is necessary for the services we provide you, or it is necessary for the
    establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or subject to safeguards that assure the protection of your
    information. We may rely on different legal mechanisms to ensure the transfer is lawful. If the recipient is in a
    country that is not deemed ‘adequate’ by the European Commission, we may enter into the ‘standard contractual
    clauses’ with the recipient. These are contracts that contain standard commitments approved by the EU Commission
    protecting the privacy and security of the information transferred.

    Please note that the privacy protections and the rights of authorities to access your information in some of these
    countries may not be the same as in your home country. We will only transfer information as permitted by law.

    contact us at privacy@metadata.org.

    <h2>11. Retention</h2>
    We may retain your information for as long as necessary in light of the purposes set out in this Notice, including
    for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements and, where required for METADATA.ORG
    to assert or defend against legal claims, until the end of the relevant retention period or until the claims in
    question have been settled.

    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of
    the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the
    purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and
    the applicable legal requirements. We also consider regulatory and guidance issued by the Data Protection
    Commission.

    <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
    You have a number of rights in relation to your information that we process. To exercise these rights, please
    contact us at privacy@metadata.org.

    While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in specific circumstances. Exceptions may also
    apply to these rights under data protection law in certain circumstances. We describe these rights below.

    Access: You have the right to request access to your information that we control.
    Data Portability: You have the right to request that some of your personal information that you initially provided
    to us is returned to you or another controller in a commonly used machine readable format.
    Rectify, Restrict and Delete: You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your information or to
    rectify or delete your information. Please note that despite a deletion request, we may continue to process your
    information if we have a legal basis to do so.
    Object: If we process your information based on our legitimate interests explained above, or in the public interest,
    you can object in certain circumstances. In such cases, where legally required to do so, we will cease processing
    your information unless we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing or where it is needed for legal
    reasons. Where we use your data for direct marketing, you can always object using the unsubscribe link in such
    communications or by contacting us at privacy@metadata.org.
    Revoke Consent: Where you have previously provided your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent to our
    processing of your information at any time. For example, you can withdraw your consent to email marketing by using
    the unsubscribe link in such communications or contacting us at privacy@metadata.org. In certain cases, we may
    continue to process your information after you have withdrawn consent if we have a legal basis to do so or if your
    withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.
    Complain: You have the right to submit a complaint about our use of your information with your local supervisory
    authority or METADATA.ORG's supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission.
